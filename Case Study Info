Management at Mobicom are worried about the high churn rate and declining ARPU which the industry is currently facing.

According to the Churn market survey report 40% of the customers are planning to switch provider in the next 12 months.

Major reasons cited in the report for switching are :
Cost and billing
Network service and quality
Recommendation of friends and family

The data has customer details on usage and other demographic variables.

There are a total of 60,000 observations across 40 variables.

I have created segments of customers by clustering and predicted the behaviour of each cluster by running logistic regression 
on each segment.
